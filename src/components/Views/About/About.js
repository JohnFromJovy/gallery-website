        Hi, my name is Li. My friends prefer call me John. I am a graduate of
        the University of Wollongong, majoring in Computer Science. I have had
        some experience working as an IT Support professional, however, the
        majority of my time has been dedicated to becoming a professional
        photographer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over a span of ten years, I have photographed more than 500 weddings,
        capturing moments for thousands of couples. Many of the wedding clients
        have since started their own families, and I have had the privilege of
        capturing many happy moments for them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while now, I feel that I have accomplished my goals as a
        photographer, and I believe it is time for me to return to the IT
        industry that I am still passionate about. I have always aspired to
        become a software engineer, but for various reasons, I was unable to
        achieve this goal. Now, I have decided to give it another shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this end, I have spent the past three months re-learning a lot of
        front-end and back-end knowledge. This includes: HTML, CSS/SASS,
        JavaScript, React, Node.js, Git, RESTful API. This project serves as a
        portfolio, a culmination of the knowledge and skills that I have
        acquired.
